Answer questions like the following:
- what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
- did you complete everything in your “needs to have” list?
- What was the hardest part of the project?
- Were there any problems you could not solve?


========================
The Reflection
========================
-My advice to my future self would be to not be scared of less in-depth planning. I spent quite a bit of time on some parts of the planning. Mostly because I thought I wouldn't understand what to do otherwise.

-I didn't exactly complete the "needs to have" of the PROPOSAL because some decisions were changed in the middle.

-The hardest part was figuring out how to handle the items. It took 2-3 weeks to figure that out. But once I did, everything (other than the saving) was a comparatively okay.

-The problems I did not solve/ things I didn't have time for
- battleScene lag
- RICKASTLEY password
- saving
- some animations
- some sound effects
- more sets
- character selection
- adding an external library (for designs)

###

Some additional thought:

The project isn't as big as I wanted it to be. But, it is satisfactory nonetheless.
It also didn't turn out as interesting as I wanted it to be. But, it is what it is.

Hope you (at least kinda) enjoy the game, Mr.Scott!
