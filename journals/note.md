found() will not be in the array --- LISTEN I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. STOP RE-THINKING. FOUND() WILL BE CALLED 
still need to do potion effects
use vectors for character movement
char and mons animations if time

hurt will be an animation
attack will be an animation
fightOP will handle XP



If there is time:
- Add pagination to Inventory
- Add an easter egg in the Inv icon
- Add a "What is my name?"
- Add a fade animation between set changes
- make settings text more flexible
